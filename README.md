# obsidian-calendar-links
obsidian-calendar-links is a vault (folder) for the **note-taking app Obsidian (Obsidian.md)**, including all required plugins, settings, and templates.

Create a note for **each day, week, month, quarter, year**, that is automatically linked within your entire calendar.

Each such calendar-note includes a **to-do-list**, divided into

- due (today, this week, ... year)
- scheduled (...)
- recurring (...)
- Backlog
- Someday

Any task, that you set, anywhere in your vault, by using the standard Markdown-format

- [ ] description due-date done-date

is captured by these to-do-lists, and will reappear in the corresponding calendar notes and sections.  Moreover, all your to-do-lists are *automatically aggregated* from day, week, ... to year.

The task management functionality is provided by the Obsidian Community-Plugin [**Obsidian-Tasks**](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) .
